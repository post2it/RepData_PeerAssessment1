## Loading and preprocessing the data


```{r one, echo=TRUE}
dataset <-  read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head (dataset)
set.seed(2)
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day? With missing DATA
exercise <- dataset[complete.cases(dataset),]
#str(exercise)
outdata <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = exercise, sum)
h <- hist(outdata$steps,  
          breaks = 9,  
          freq = T,
          col = "cyan", 
          main = "Activity",
          xlab = "Number of daily steps")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
steps<-outdata$steps
options(digits = 5)
mean1 <- mean(steps)
mean(steps)
median1 <- median(steps)
median(steps)
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day? With missing DATA

## I am stuck on interval question and submitting what is working.

```
##### The mean is `r  mean1`   and the median is `r median1` for dataset with missing data.
